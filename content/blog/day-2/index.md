Yesterday was an easy day. We didn't really touch our computers and today we're starting with the basics. Using the terminal to navigate, create and delete directories and files. 

```
cd : change directory
ls : list files and dirctories
mkdir : create new directory
touch : make a new file(make sure to add file type to the end - 
    for instance readme.md or note.txt)
rm : delete
rm -f : force delete

```
As well as using the up arrow to cycle through previous commands.
